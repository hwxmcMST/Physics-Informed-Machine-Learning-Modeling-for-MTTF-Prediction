# Physics-Informed-Machine-Learning-Modeling-for-MTTF-Prediction

The goal of this research is to develop a adaptive surrogate modeling method to predict the mean time to failure for complex system.
The active learning function is develop to select the optimal training points to refine the model.

Please go to see Main.m file and a mathmatical example with four failure modes in mixed system is used to varify the proposed method
